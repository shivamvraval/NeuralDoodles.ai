Phone Addiction is a real problem, hindering creative content creation and focused deep work. 

This is a start to a list to how I am trying to tackle it:
1. Music: A work/focus classical music/instrumental playlist with headphones to cancel noise.
2. Track and limit phone use: I found my usual phone usage was upwards of 5-6hrs!!! Sometime I would just check notifications even when there are none!
3. Stable work environment: Work in a cafe, in a office or study area.
3. Focused time blocks: this is yet to be implemented, but a set of focused time blocks to aid deep work
