This is a start to my own personal site. Since the last year, I have come to realize the importance of writing and putting things down. Not only just putting things down, but putting them down in an accessible manner. The biggest issue I had when I started grad school was annotating papers. Somehow it felt wrong to just scribble and waste paper, so I started using an ipad. this worked well for a while. Now I want to go a step further and distill ideas/ thoughts about papers/ or just anything else that comes to mind. And so I'm starting to write.

This "website" is my nth attempt at enforcing discipline and motivation about the things that I find inspiring but keep telling myself I dont have enough time for them.

Things like: making art, hand drawn or digital, Reading for leisure and work, Learning new facts, playing around with GPT/Stable diffusion for fun, etc.

<b>Ideally I hope to write everyday, but we shall see how it goes.</b>
